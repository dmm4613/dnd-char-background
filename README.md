# Dungeons and Dragons Character Creation

This project is to explore NLP models in an attempt to create a functioning app that will take in user input and provide a short back story for the user. 

Users will enter the Character Name, Character Species, and Character Class. 

## MVP #1: Predict on a data set that name, species, class will give back related character back story.

## MVP 2: Fine tune a Seq2Seq model to work on encoding/decoding the dataset to learn over time. 

## MVP 3: Utilize fine tuned model and create a live web app that will allow users to input three variables
